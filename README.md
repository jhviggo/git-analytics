# Git Analytics
Git Analytics is a tool for analysing repositories to get an overview of potential issues.

## Purpose
This is the final project for my Datamatiker degree (AP CS)

# How to use
* Clone the repo onto your machine
* Install the packages `npm i`
* Create a `.env` file and set the repository you want to analyse as `CMD_PATH="path/to/git/repo"`
* run the service with `npm run dev`
